### Arras Energy is a simulation platform for California's future electricity distribution power systems.

Arras Energy is the commercial-grade release of HiPAS GridLAB-D, a research simulator developed by the US Department of Energy, supported and distributed by Linux Foundation Energy.

### Abstract
GridLAB-D is and used to study future electricity distribution systems that include advanced grid technology, emerging
customer end-uses, and distributed energy resources such as solar panel, energy storage, and
electric vehicle chargers. HiPAS GridLAB-D is a commercial-grade high-performance version of
the DOE software that is developed for four important analysis use-cases for California, i.e.,
load electrification, hosting capacity analysis, tariff analysis, and distribution system resilience
analysis. These four use-cases address California climate change mitigation goals, including
electricity infrastructure decarbonization, as well as the response to climate change impacts on
electricity distribution system infrastructure, such as wildfire planning and operations.

HiPAS GridLAB-D is delivered as an open-source product available free-of-charge for users, and
easily installed on the most widely used computing platforms, including cloud systems, on
premise servers, desktop workstations, and laptop computers. The software support and
maintenance infrastructure is open to contributors, and administered by a team of professional
software engineers, in consultation with a highly experienced team of electrical and
mechanical engineers.

HiPAS GridLAB-D has been adopted by the Linux Foundation Energy, an open source
foundation focused on the power systems sector, and hosted within the Linux Foundation to
provide a neutral, collaborative community to build the shared digital investments that are
transforming the world's relationship to energy.
